Chaos testing, a mini site devoting to descructive testing



About Chaos testing:

Chaos testing was largely popularlized by Netflix with their program "Choas Monkey". This site is about a set of open source examples and frameworks to simplify doing chaos testing. We are initially doing our sample code in GO, but hope to move to Ruby and Node.Js in the future.
